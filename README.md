# Assembly MIPS (Computer Architecture)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **computer architecture** implemented in **Assembly MIPS programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Computer Architecture** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository hosts a collection of exercises focused on programming in Assembly MIPS, particularly translating C programs into MIPS assembly language. <br>
Assembly MIPS is fundamental for understanding computer architecture and low-level programming concepts, providing insights into how high-level languages are translated into machine code.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Low-Level Programming**: Gain proficiency in low-level programming concepts by writing programs in Assembly MIPS.
- **Computer Architecture**: Understand the MIPS architecture, its instruction set, and memory management techniques.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn optimization techniques specific to MIPS assembly to improve program efficiency and speed.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Basic Instructions**: Exercises on basic MIPS instructions such as load/store, arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Control Structures**: Exercises involving conditional statements and loops in MIPS assembly.
- **Function Calls**: Exercises on handling function calls and parameter passing in MIPS.
- **Memory Management**: Exercises focusing on memory access and addressing modes in MIPS assembly.
